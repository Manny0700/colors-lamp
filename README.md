# COLORS Web Application

## Overview

The COLORS Web Application is a frontend implementation of the COLORS lab project developed for COP4331.  
This application provides a structured and user-friendly interface for interacting with color-based features in a clean and responsive environment. The user will be allowed to search, add, and save colors directly into the website.

The project emphasizes proper frontend architecture, organized code structure, and clear separation of responsibilities between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
